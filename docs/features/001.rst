UEFI Secure boot covering the verification of non-secure world software
#######################################################################

See the list of `supported devices
<https://trusted-substrate.readthedocs.io/en/latest/hardware/supported_platforms.html>`_

Description
***********

UEFI Secure Boot is a verification mechanism for ensuring that code launched by
a computerâ€™s UEFI firmware is trusted. It is designed to protect a system
against malicious code being loaded and executed early in the boot process,
before the operating system has been loaded.

How to build
************

UEFI Secure Boot is part of the Trusted Substrate featureset.  It's enabled by
default on all supported platforms.  You can find detailed instructions in
`Trusted Substrate <https://trusted-substrate.readthedocs.io/en/latest/building/build_source.html#building-from-source>`_

How to run
**********

UEFI Secure Boot is part of the firmware implementation.  You can find
instructions on it's usage and enablement `here
